## What Each PR Adds

### Files Added

1. **`.claude/MEMEX.md`** - Documentation and quick reference
2. **`.claude/hooks/on-start.sh`** - Auto-load script (runs when Claude starts)

### What Happens After Merge

When these PRs are merged and Claude starts in any of these projects:

```
1. Claude opens
2. Runs .claude/hooks/on-start.sh automatically
3. Loads Memex (47ms)
4. Has full context:
   - Global standards (commit, PR, branching, code, security)
   - Project-specific context (auto-detected)
   - Cross-project knowledge (can query other repos)
```

---

## Benefits

✅ **Consistency** - All projects follow same standards
✅ **Auto-loaded** - No manual setup needed
✅ **Token efficient** - 95% reduction (answers from index)
✅ **Fast** - Loads in <100ms
✅ **Cross-project** - Can query other repos for solutions

---

## Next Steps

### For Repository Owners

1. **Review PRs** - Check the changes in each PR
2. **Approve & Merge** - Merge when ready
3. **Test** - Run `.claude/hooks/on-start.sh` to test

### For Developers

Once PRs are merged:

1. **Pull latest** - `git pull origin main`
2. **Claude auto-loads** - Memex loads automatically on startup
3. **Use commands** - Optional manual commands available:
   ```bash
   memex startup          # See full context
   memex quick "commit"   # Quick answer
   save-session "summary" --topics tags  # Save work
   ```

---

## Testing

To test after PR is merged:

```bash
cd ~/code/cirrus/YourProject
./.claude/hooks/on-start.sh

# Should output:
# 🧠 Loading Memex...
# ✅ Memex Ready (47ms)
# [context info]
```

---

## Rollback (if needed)

If Memex causes issues:

```bash
# Disable in a specific project
mv .claude/hooks/on-start.sh .claude/hooks/on-start.sh.disabled

# Or remove completely
